## OmegaFold

OmegaFold is a groundbreaking computational method for high-resolution protein structure prediction from a single primary sequence, without the need for multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) or evolutionary information.

### Key Features

- Predicts high-resolution protein structures from primary sequences alone
- Combines a protein language model with a geometry-inspired transformer model
- Effective for orphan proteins and fast-evolving proteins like antibodies
- Outperforms RoseTTAFold and achieves similar accuracy to AlphaFold2 on recent structures

### Applications

- Accurate predictions for orphan proteins not belonging to characterized protein families
- Effective structure prediction for antibodies with noisy MSAs due to fast evolution
- Potential insights into the natural protein folding process
